# Note Taker 

## This Repository

This repository is where I am working on a Note Taker web app as part of a coding bootcamp. The main objective of this assignment was to practice Express.js and understand GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. Data is written to db.json. This was also an introduction to using Insomnia.

## Usage

From the homepage, click the Getting Started button. It will load your previous notes on the left side. You can type in a Title and Text and click Save Note to save the note. Clicking on a note will bring it into the editing area. The red trashcan button on each note will remove the note (WIP).
